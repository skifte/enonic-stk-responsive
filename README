A responsive and simplified version of The Enonic STK - Standard Templating Kit (http://www.enonic.com/en/docs/stk)

Responsive Templating Kit Demo available at http://responsive.skifte.com

Works with Enonic CMS versions 4.4.x - 4.7.1 (released 10 jan 2013).


Main differences

Config-responsive.xml
- Grid system based on Bootstrap
- <region> aka columns are wrapped in <area> aka rows for setting up the grid system
- Default image settings moved to the "device agnostic" part of the config.xml so that it doesn't have to be repeated. Settings may be overriden per device class.
- No theme

Region.xsl
- Removed CSS templates
- Calculates column and image width based on the grid system defined in config.xml

Page.xsl
- Removed mobile and desktop templates
- Same markup (including the head section) regardless of device class
- Added a system region for scripts

Other
- HTML5
- Reorganzed folders
- Removed scripts and styling. Included Bootstrap CSS via CDN.
- Added the tablet device class (to libraries/resolvers/device-classification.xsl)
- Device classification is mainly used for serving optimized images



For any new site you'd typically want to create local ("private") copies of the config.xml, the region.xsl and the page.xsl. The rest can easily be shared between multiple sites whitout (very much) hassle.
